# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A portfolio website where I showcase my best recent work/applications.

## Description

This is a new portfolio website project showing my best recent work/applications using Bootstrap5. It was a chance to redo some of the previous ideas used in my initial developerFolio project (link: https://bogdana-et.github.io/developerFolio/), this time utilizing Bootstrap5. I learned how to optimize Bootstrap5 components and customize them to my liking and to the needs of the site.

## Usage

To use the website, you have to click the following link, and feel free to use the navigation on the top of the page to see different sections of the page. I have also included links in the contact section with social media contact details.
